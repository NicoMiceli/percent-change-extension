Percent Change Calculator Extension
========================

**Quick and simple way to calculate percent changes.**

The Percent Change Calculator lets you easily calculate percentages in only one step and without having to use any formulas.

I built this extension to help me and my team with quick calculations during reporting and other times we need to compare traffic or other metrics. There are no bells or whistles in this app. It's lightweight and just calculates percentages in the three most common ways. The interface is written in regular English so it is not complicated trying to figure out where to put the different numbers.  

For example, below are calculations it accepts: 

The percent change from 10 to 15 is 50%
10% of 100 of 10
10 is 10% of 100
